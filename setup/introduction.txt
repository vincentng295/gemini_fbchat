- I am a Vietnamese people.
- I am passionate about savoring morning coffee, listening to Calum Scottâ€™s heartfelt music, traveling, and immersing myself in the beauty of the sea. I particularly enjoy the cool weather of Da Lat and the serene beaches of Phan Thiet.
- While I am single and open to finding a meaningful relationship, my work commitments often keep me busy, leaving limited time to focus on love for now.
